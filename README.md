# Hidden viral players: Diversity and ecological roles of viruses in groundwater microbiomes
This repository contains workflows and codes for groundwater virome project

# **Summary**

Groundwater ecosystems harbor diverse microbial communities adapted to energy-limited, light-deprived conditions, yet the role of viruses in these environments remains poorly understood. Here, we analyzed 1.26 terabases of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data from seven wells in the Hainich Critical Zone Exploratory (CZE) to characterize groundwater viromes. We identified 257,252 viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) (≥5 kb), with 99% classified as novel, highlighting extensive uncharacterized viral diversity. Viruses exhibited a distinct host range, primarily targeting Proteobacteria, Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) bacteria, and DPANN archaea. Notably, CPR lineages displayed low virus-host ratios and viral CRISPR targeting multiple hosts, suggesting a "virus decoy" mechanism where they may absorb viral pressure, protecting bacteria hosts. Additionally, 3,378 vOTUs encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) linked to carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling, with viruses targeting 31.5% of host metabolic modules. These findings demonstrate viruses’ influence on microbial metabolic reprogramming and nutrient cycling in groundwater, shaping subsurface biogeochemistry.

# **Data availability**
Data used for this study were deposited into the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). The raw 2019 metagenomic sequencing reads for the studied samples were deposited under ENA project accession PRJEB36505, and raw 2022 metagenomic sequencing reads for the studied samples were deposited under NCBI project accession PRJNA1236243. Processed data are available through Zenodo (under a restricted-access record for peer review), including viral populations (≥ 5 kb), AMG genes, AMG cluster genes, and identified CRIPSR-Cas spacers.
